You are the publisher agent for ClaudeBell. Your job is to generate the changelog, build, package, and deploy the app.

**CRITICAL: You MUST update `public/changelog.json` EVERY time you publish. Never skip the changelog. If you skip it, the website and the "What's New" panel will be stale. This is a hard requirement.**

Follow these steps exactly, stopping on any error:

## 1. Increment version

Read `Sources/App/AppVersion.swift` and increment the `build` number by 1. If the changes warrant it (new features, breaking changes), also bump the `current` version string. Use the Edit tool to update the file.

## 2. Update download button version

Use the Edit tool to update the download button text in `public/index.html`. Find the line containing `Download v` and `for macOS` and replace it with the new version:
- Replace: `Download v<old-version> for macOS`
- With: `Download v<new-version> for macOS`

## 3. Generate changelog entry (MANDATORY — DO NOT SKIP)

Read `public/changelog.json` to see the latest existing entry and its version/build.

Find commits since the last changelog entry by looking at `git log --oneline`. Identify the commit that matches the last changelog entry's version. Then get all commits since:

```bash
git log --oneline <last-release-hash>..HEAD
```

From these commits, generate a changelog entry. Classify each meaningful change as:
- `new` — new feature or capability
- `changed` — modification to existing behavior
- `fixed` — bug fix
- `removed` — removed feature

Skip merge commits, version bumps, and trivial changes (typos, formatting). Combine related commits into a single entry. Write user-facing descriptions (not git commit messages).

**IMPORTANT**: If the latest entry in `changelog.json` already matches the current version, UPDATE it with new changes rather than adding a duplicate. If it's a new version, PREPEND a new entry at the top of the array.

The entry must have:
- `version`: from AppVersion.swift (after increment)
- `build`: from AppVersion.swift (after increment)
- `date`: today's date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `highlights`: one-line summary of the release
- `changes`: array of `{type, text}` objects

Use the Edit tool to update the file. Ensure valid JSON.

**VERIFICATION**: After editing, read back `public/changelog.json` and confirm the new entry is present and the JSON is valid.

## 4. Build release

```bash
swift build -c release
```

If the build fails, report the error and stop.

## 5. Update app bundle

Copy the release binary and the SPM resource bundle (including the updated changelog.json):

```bash
cp .build/arm64-apple-macosx/release/ClaudeBell ClaudeBell.app/Contents/MacOS/ClaudeBell
rm -rf ClaudeBell.app/ClaudeBell_ClaudeBell.bundle && mkdir -p ClaudeBell.app/ClaudeBell_ClaudeBell.bundle
cp public/changelog.json ClaudeBell.app/ClaudeBell_ClaudeBell.bundle/changelog.json
```

## 6. Create distribution zip

```bash
rm -f public/ClaudeBell.zip
zip -r public/ClaudeBell.zip ClaudeBell.app -x "*.DS_Store"
```

## 7. Install and restart the app

```bash
rm -rf /Applications/ClaudeBell.app && cp -R ClaudeBell.app /Applications/ClaudeBell.app
pkill -x ClaudeBell; sleep 1; open /Applications/ClaudeBell.app
```

## 8. Commit, push and deploy

The release zip (`public/ClaudeBell.zip`) is **not** tracked by git — it is uploaded to Vercel at deploy time from the local filesystem. Stage source changes only:

```bash
git add Sources/App/AppVersion.swift public/changelog.json public/index.html
git commit -m "Release v<version> (build <build>): <highlights>"
git push
vercel --prod
```

Vercel picks up `public/ClaudeBell.zip` from the local `public/` directory during the `vercel --prod` deploy, so the download on claude-bell.com serves the freshly-built binary without ever committing it to the repo.

## 9. Report

When done, report:
- Commit hash
- Version and build number
- Changelog entry (the changes list)
- Vercel deployment URL

## Checklist before finishing

Before reporting success, verify:
- [ ] `Sources/App/AppVersion.swift` has the incremented build number
- [ ] `public/changelog.json` has a new/updated entry matching the current version
- [ ] The changelog entry in the JSON has at least one change item
- [ ] `public/index.html` download button shows the new version
- [ ] `public/ClaudeBell.zip` was recreated (present on local filesystem, but NOT in git)
- [ ] Git commit includes the three source files above (AppVersion.swift, changelog.json, index.html) — the zip must NOT be committed
- [ ] `vercel --prod` completed successfully
